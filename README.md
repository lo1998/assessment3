# Assessment3 Deep Learning, Deakin University, Melbourne
Welcome to my GitHub repository:
Here you can find my multi class image classification model including the web app for assessment 3 in deep learning at my exchange semster at Deakin University. I created several cnn models with data augmentation. For the assessment I also needed to create a web app and use tensorboard for visualisation and control the time consumption of the model. 
Grade: HD
